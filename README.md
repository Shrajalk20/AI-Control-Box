# AI-Control-Box

AI Controlbox is a modular, scalable AI orchestration system designed to control, coordinate, and manage AI agents, tools, or microservices through a unified interface.

Unlike traditional AI interfaces (like ChatGPT), AI Controlbox empowers users to transparently view the AI’s internal "thinking process" — enabling deeper insights, better debugging, and greater trust in the output. Think of it as an AI control room with full visibility and flexibility.

🚀 Key Features

🧠 Agent Orchestration: Control multiple AI agents or micro-models from a single interface.
🔍 Thought Traceability: View how AI reaches conclusions step-by-step — perfect for debugging, learning, or governance.
🛠 Tool Integration: Plug in custom tools, APIs, or services the AI can use in real-time.
🔄 Modular Design: Easily swap or extend agents, models, or workflows.
⚙️ Hybrid Stack: Python for backend orchestration, TypeScript for UI/API layer, PostgreSQL for database.
📡 Real-Time Feedback: Stream step-by-step reasoning and actions live.
🔐 Transparent AI: Not just what the AI thinks — but how.

🛠 Tech Stack
Layer	Technology
Backend	Python (FastAPI / Flask / custom orchestration)
Frontend/API	TypeScript (React / Next.js / Node.js)
Agent Core	OpenAI / Langchain / Custom Tools
